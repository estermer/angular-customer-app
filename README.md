# Angular Customer App

a single page web application that allows a user to Create, List, Update and Delete customers.  A customer is made of up the following attributes:

- Name
- Email
- Telephone
- Address
 - Street
 - City
 - State

The web application should use .json files as the storage mechanism for each customer record.
